Cloned/forked from [Deep-Neural-Network-from-scratch](https://github.com/Coding-Lane/Deep-Neural-Network-from-scratch) by [Coding-Lane](https://github.com/Coding-Lane).

In this repository, a deep neural network is built from scratch with no Tensorflow, just using the linear algebra equations.  This example covers a variable number of neural networks layers, L-layers.
